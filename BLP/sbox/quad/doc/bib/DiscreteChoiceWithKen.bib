On the demand side, discrete choice model is adopted, that is estimated using micro data from the Consumer Expenditure Survey. The estimation results are used in conjunction with population weights to derive aggregate demand. On the supply side, the automobile industry is modelled as an oligopoly with product differentiation. Equilibrium is characterized by the first order conditions of the profit maximizing firms. The estimation results are used in counterfactual simulations to investigate two trade policy issues: the effects of the VER, and exchange rate pass-through.},

  abstract            = {Economists have been paying increasing attention to the study of situations in which consumers face a discrete rather than a continuous set of choices. Such models are potentially very important in evaluating the impact of government programs upon consumer welfare. But little has been said in general regarding the tools of applied welfare economics in discrete choice situations. This paper shows how the conventional methods of applied welfare economics can be modified to handle such cases. It focuses on the computation of the excess burden of taxation, and the evaluation of quality change. The results are applied to stochastic utility models, including the popular cases of probit and logit analysis. Throughout, the emphasis is on providing rigorous guidelines for carrying out applied work.},
